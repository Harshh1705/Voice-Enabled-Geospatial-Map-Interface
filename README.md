# Voice-Enabled Geospatial Map Interface

## Overview

This project, developed by Team 64bit, is a web application that integrates geospatial maps with voice commands for enhanced user interaction. It utilizes OpenStreetMap for map tiles and Leaflet.js for interactive map features. Voice commands are recognized using TensorFlow's speech command model, enabling users to control map functionalities hands-free.

## Usage and commands

- Speak voice commands recognized by the application to interact with the map:
  - for zooming in functionality speak the command = "right"
  - for zooming out functionality speak the command = "left"
  - for showing road layers speak the command = "down"
  - for removing road layers speak the command = "down"
  - for navigating to Bangalore speak the command = "go"
 
 
## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Harshh1705/problem-statement-4-solution-team-64bit.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.


    
## Technologies Used

- **OpenStreetMap**: Provides map tiles for the application.
- **Leaflet.js**: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning platform for implementing the speech command model.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for front-end development and application logic.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes TensorFlowâ€™s speech command model for hands-free operation.
